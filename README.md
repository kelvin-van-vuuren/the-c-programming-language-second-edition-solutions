## The C Programming Language Second Edition (Solutions)
My solutions to the exercises in the book [The C Programming Language - Second Edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language) by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie.

* C Standard is C89 aka ANSI C.
* Organised in folders for each chapter and one source file per exercise.
* Test cases are included in most exercises via the main function.
* Developed using my [Neovim config](https://github.com/kelvin-van-vuuren/nvim) and [terminal emulator build](https://github.com/kelvin-van-vuuren/st)
